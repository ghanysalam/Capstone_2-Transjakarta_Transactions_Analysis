## About The Project
Dataset from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dikisahkan/transjakarta-transportation-transaction)

# **Background**
Transjakarta is one of the modes of mass transportation most widely used by the people of Jakarta and its surroundings. With easy access and integration with other modes of transportation, Transjakarta has become the choice of many people for their daily activities. However, with the increasing number of users, there is a need for data analysis to understand user behavior and service efficiency.


## **Problem Statement**

The Transjakarta company is faced with a problem, namely the increasing number of users and the complexity of the route network. Understanding user characteristics and behavior can provide insight into how to improve service quality. In-depth data analysis is needed to understand usage patterns and service efficiency on Transjakarta.

## **Goals**

Understanding Transjakarta user behavior and travel times from the most used corridors through transaction data analysis with the aim of increasing user satisfaction in using Transjakarta and reducing congestion in Jakarta.

# What's covered in the analysis?

This project analysis generally aims to provide insights on the day-to-day operations of NYC taxi. Starting from a raw dataset that's been provided which includes the information about taxi trips collected from the taxis. In general, the steps done in the project will consists of:
1. Data Preparation
2. Data Cleaning
4. Data Analysis
5. Conclusion & Key Findings
6. Reccomendations
